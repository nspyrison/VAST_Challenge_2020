	abstract = {Most visualization techniques have traditionally used two-dimensional, instead of three-dimensional representations to visualize multidimensional and multivariate data. In this article, a way to demonstrate the underlying superiority of three-dimensional, with respect to two-dimensional, representation is proposed. Specifically, it is based on the inevitable quality degradation produced when reducing the data dimensionality. The problem is tackled from two different approaches: a visual and an analytical approach. First, a set of statistical tests (point classification, distance perception, and outlier identification) using the two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualization are carried out on a group of 40 users. The results indicate that there is an improvement in the accuracy introduced by the inclusion of a third dimension; however, these results do not allow to obtain definitive conclusions on the superiority of three-dimensional representation. Therefore, in order to draw further conclusions, a deeper study based on an analytical approach is proposed. The aim is to quantify the real loss of quality produced when the data are visualized in two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces, in relation to the original data dimensionality, to analyze the difference between them. To achieve this, a recently proposed methodology is used. The results obtained by the analytical approach reported that the loss of quality reaches significantly high values only when switching from three-dimensional to two-dimensional representation. The considerable quality degradation suffered in the two-dimensional visualization strongly suggests the suitability of the third dimension to visualize data.},

	abstract = {Statistical graphics play a crucial role in exploratory data analysis, model checking, and diagnosis. The lineup protocol enables statistical significance testing of visual findings, bridging the gulf between exploratory and inferential statistics. In this article, inferential methods for statistical graphics are developed further by refining the terminology of visual inference and framing the lineup protocol in a context that allows direct comparison with conventional tests in scenarios when a conventional test exists. This framework is used to compare the performance of the lineup protocol against conventional statistical testing in the scenario of fitting linear models. A human subjects experiment is conducted using simulated data to provide controlled conditions. Results suggest that the lineup protocol performs comparably with the conventional tests, and expectedly outperforms them when data are contaminated, a scenario where assumptions required for performing a conventional test are violated. Surprisingly, visual tests have higher power than the conventional tests when the effect size is large. And, interestingly, there may be some super-visual individuals who yield better performance and power than the conventional test even in the most difficult tasks. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Projection pursuit for classiﬁcation ﬁnds projections that reveal differences between classes. Even though projection pursuit is used to bypass the curse of dimensionality, most indexes will not work well when there are a small number of observations relative to the number of variables, known as a large p (dimension) small n (sample size) problem. This paper discusses the relationship between the sample size and dimensionality on classiﬁcation and proposes a new projection pursuit index that overcomes the problem of small sample size for exploratory classiﬁcation.},

The data views are designed for data that have a multivariate component. The approach to displaying data comes from earlier research on building statistical graphics based on data pipelines, in which different aspects of data processing and graphical rendering are organized conceptually into segments of a pipeline. The software design takes advantage of the object-oriented nature of the Java language to open up the data pipeline, allowing developers to have greater control over their visualization applications. Importantly, new types of data views coded to adhere to a few simple design requirements can easily be integrated with existing pipe sections. This allows access to sophisticated linking and dynamic interaction across all (new and existing) view types. Pipe segments can be accessed from data analysis packages such as Omegahat or R, providing a tight coupling of visual and numerical methods.},

	abstract = {A dynamic graphical method is one in which a data analyst interacts in real time with a data display on a computer graphics terminal. Using a screen input device such as a mouse, the analyst can specify, in a visual way, points or regions on the display and cause aspects of the display to change nearly instantaneously. Brushing is a collection of dynamic methods for viewing multidimensional data. It is very effective when used on a scatterplot matrix, a rectangular array of all pairwise scatterplots of the variables. Four brushing operations—highlight, shadow highlight, delete, and label—are carried out by moving a mouse-controlled rectangle, called the brush, over one of the scatterplots. The effect of an operation appears simultaneously on all scatterplots. Three paint modes—transient, lasting, and undo—and the ability to change the shape of the brush allow the analyst to specify collections of points on which the operations are carried out. Brushing can be used in various ways or on certain types of data; these usages are called brush techniques and include the following: single-point and cluster linking, conditioning on a single variable, conditioning on two variables, subsetting with categorical variables, and stationarity probing of a time series.},

	abstract = {Projection pursuit describes a procedure for searching high-dimensional data for “interesting” low-dimensional projections via the optimization of a criterion function called the projection pursuit index. By empirically examining the optimization process for several projection pursuit indexes, we observed differences in the types of structure that maximized each index. We were especially curious about differences between two indexes based on expansions in terms of orthogonal polynomials, the Legendre index, and the Hermite index. Being fast to compute, these indexes are ideally suited for dynamic graphics implementations. Both Legendre and Hermite indexes are weighted L 2 distances between the density of the projected data and a standard normal density. A general form for this type of index is introduced that encompasses both indexes. The form clarifies the effects of the weight function on the index's sensitivity to differences from normality, highlighting some conceptual problems with the Legendre and Hermite indexes. A new index, called the Natural Hermite index, which alleviates some of these problems, is introduced. A polynomial expansion of the data density reduces the form of the index to a sum of squares of the coefficients used in the expansion. This drew our attention to examining these coefficients as indexes in their own right. We found that the first two coefficients, and the lowest-order indexes produced by them, are the most useful ones for practical data exploration because they respond to structure that can be analytically identified, and because they have “long-sighted” vision that enables them to “see” large structure from a distance. Complementing this low-order behavior, the higher-order indexes are “short-sighted.” They are able to see intricate structure, but only when they are close to it. We also show some practical use of projection pursuit using the polynomial indexes, including a discovery of previously unseen structure in a set of telephone usage data, and two cautionary examples which illustrate that structure found is not always meaningful.},

Traditional grids of scatterplots often obscure important features of the data when one or more variables are categorical but coded as numerical. The generalized pairs plot oﬀers a range of displays of paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A mosaic plot, ﬂuctuation diagram, or facetted bar chart may be used to display two categorical variables. A side-byside boxplot, stripplot, facetted histogram, or density plot helps visualize a categorical and a quantitative variable. A traditional scatterplot is suitable for displaying a pair of numerical variables, but options also support density contours or annotating summary statistics such as the correlation and number of missing values, for example. Two diﬀerent packages provide implementations of the generalized pairs plot, gpairs and {GGally}. The use of the generalized pairs plot may reveal structure in multivariate data which otherwise might go unnoticed in the process of exploratory data analysis.

However, data mining strategies are often applied to massive data sets where visualization may not be very successful because of the limits of both screen resolution, human visual system resolution as well as the limits of available computational resources.

	abstract = {{SummaryIn} this paper, we present some graphical techniques for cluster analysis of high-dimensional data. Parallel coordinate plots and parallel coordinate density plots are graphical techniques which map multivariate data into a two-dimensional display. The method has some elegant duality properties with ordinary Cartesian plots so that higher-dimensional mathematical structures can be analyzed. Our high interaction software allows for rapid editing of data to remove outliers and isolate clusters by brushing. Our brushing techniques allow not only for hue adjustment, but also for saturation adjustment. Saturation adjustment allows for the handling of comparatively massive data sets by using the α-channel of the Silicon Graphics workstation to compensate for heavy overplotting.The grand tour is a generalized rotation of coordinate axes in a high-dimensional space. Coupled with the full-dimensional plots allowed by the parallel coordinate display, these techniques allow the data analyst to explore data which is both high-dimensional and massive in size. In this paper we give a description of both techniques and illustrate their use to do inverse regression and clustering. We have used these techniques to analyze data on the order of 250,000 observations in 8 dimensions. Because the analysis requires the use of color graphics, in the present paper we illustrate the methods with a more modest data set of 3848 observations. Other illustrations are available on our web page.},

Flow direction maps, computed during bundling, can be visualized separately (vertical or horizontal components) or as a single image using the Oriented Line Integral Convolution ({OLIC}) algorithm. Furthermore, cosine similarity between two flow direction maps provides a similarity map to compare two scanpaths. Last, we provide examples of basic patterns, visual search task, and art perception.

We recover the functional nature of the curves by representing them as linear combinations of piecewise-polynomial basis functions with associated expansion coefﬁcients. Next, we express all curves in a given cluster in terms of a centroid curve and a complementary term, via a set of so-called principal component functions. Based on the above, we propose a two-fold contribution: First, we use cluster centroids to design a new bundling method for 2D and 3D curve-sets. Secondly, we deform the cluster centroids and generate new curves along them, which enables us to modify the underlying data in a statistically-controlled way via its simpliﬁed (bundled) view. We demonstrate our method by applications on real-world 2D and 3D datasets for graph bundling, trajectory analysis, and vector ﬁeld and tensor ﬁeld visualization.},

	abstract = {{FiberClay} is an immersive multidimensional visualization system. The user can navigate into trail sets to gain a better understanding of dense and complex datasets. Left, the user activated the union brushing interaction to select trails intersected by the two beams in a recorded aircraft trajectory dataset. Middle, the user investigates {DTI} fiber tracks connecting the two hemisphere of the brain. Right, the user refine a data selection by visually sculpting the query with the two brush interactions while navigating into the different visual mappings (e.g. presets) of the investigated dataset. Abstract— Visualizing 3D trajectories to extract insights about their similarities and spatial configuration is a critical task in several domains. Air traffic controllers for example deal with large quantities of aircrafts routes to optimize safety in airspace and neuroscientists attempt to understand neuronal pathways in the human brain by visualizing bundles of fibers from {DTI} images. Extracting insights from masses of 3D trajectories is challenging as the multiple three dimensional lines have complex geometries, may overlap, cross or even merge with each other, making it impossible to follow individual ones in dense areas. As trajectories are inherently spatial and three dimensional, we propose {FiberClay}: a system to display and interact with 3D trajectories in immersive environments. {FiberClay} renders a large quantity of trajectories in real time using {GP}-{GPU} techniques. {FiberClay} also introduces a new set of interactive techniques for composing complex queries in 3D space leveraging immersive environment controllers and user position. These techniques enable an analyst to select and compare sets of trajectories with specific geometries and data properties. We conclude by discussing insights found using {FiberClay} with domain experts in air traffic control and neurology.},

One key challenge that increases the size of the exploration space is the number of views that one can generate from a single dataset, based on the use of multiple parameter values and exploration paths. Often, no such single view contains all needed insights. The question thus arises of how we can efﬁciently combine insights from multiple views of a dataset. We propose a set of techniques that considerably reduce the exploration effort for such situations, based on the explicit depiction of the view space, using a small multiple metaphor. We leverage this view space by offering interactive techniques that enable users to explicitly create, visualize, and follow their exploration path. This way, partial insights obtained from each view can be efﬁciently and effectively combined.

	shorttitle = {Image-Based Visualization},
	abstract = {Our society has entered a data-driven era, one in which not only are enormous amounts of data being generated daily but there are also growing expectations placed on the analysis of this data. Some data have become simply too large to be displayed and some have too short a lifespan to be handled properly with classical visualization or analysis methods. In order to address these issues, this book explores the potential solutions where we not only visualize data, but also allow users to be able to interact with it. Therefore, this book will focus on two main topics: large dataset visualization and interaction. Graphic cards and their image processing power can leverage large data visualization but they can also be of great interest to support interaction. Therefore, this book will show how to take advantage of graphic card computation power with techniques called {GPGPUs} (general-purpose computing on graphics processing units). As specific examples, this book details {GPGPU} usages to produce fast enough visualization to be interactive with improved brushing techniques, fast animations between different data representations, and view simplifications (i.e. static and dynamic bundling techniques). Since data storage and memory limitation is less and less of an issue, we will also present techniques to reduce computation time by using memory as a new tool to solve computationally challenging problems. We will investigate innovative data processing techniques: while classical algorithms are expressed in data space (e.g. computation on geographic locations), we will express them in graphic space (e.g., raster map like a screen composed of pixels). This consists of two steps: (1) a data representation is built using straightforward visualization techniques; and (2) the resulting image undergoes purely graphical transformations using image processing techniques. This type of technique is called image-based visualization. The goal of this book is to explore new computing techniques using image-based techniques to provide efficient visualizations and user interfaces for the exploration of large datasets. This book concentrates on the areas of information visualization, visual analytics, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction. This book opens up a whole field of study, including the scientific validation of these techniques, their limitations, and their generalizations to different types of datasets.},

This gap leads to a lack of distinction between the ends and means of a task, limiting the potential for rigorous analysis. We contribute a multi-level typology of visualization tasks to address this gap, distinguishing why and how a visualization task is performed, as well as what the task inputs and outputs are. Our typology allows complex tasks to be expressed as sequences of interdependent simpler tasks, resulting in concise and ﬂexible descriptions for tasks of varying complexity and scope. It provides abstract rather than domain-speciﬁc descriptions of tasks, so that useful comparisons can be made between visualization systems targeted at different application domains. This descriptive power supports a level of analysis required for the generation of new designs, by guiding the translation of domain-speciﬁc problems into abstract tasks, and for the qualitative evaluation of visualization usage. We demonstrate the beneﬁts of our approach in a detailed case study, comparing task descriptions from our typology to those derived from related work. We also discuss the similarities and differences between our typology and over two dozen extant classiﬁcation systems and theoretical frameworks from the literatures of visualization, humancomputer interaction, information retrieval, communications, and cartography.},

	abstract = {The ability to synthesize realistic patterns of neural activity is crucial for studying neural information processing. Here we used the Generative Adversarial Networks ({GANs}) framework to simulate the concerted activity of a population of neurons. We adapted the Wasserstein-{GAN} variant to facilitate the generation of unconstrained neural population activity patterns while still beneﬁting from parameter sharing in the temporal domain. We demonstrate that our proposed {GAN}, which we termed Spike-{GAN}, generates spike trains that match accurately the ﬁrst- and second-order statistics of datasets of tens of neurons and also approximates well their higher-order statistics. We applied Spike-{GAN} to a real dataset recorded from salamander retina and showed that it performs as well as state-ofthe-art approaches based on the maximum entropy and the dichotomized Gaussian frameworks. Importantly, Spike-{GAN} does not require to specify a priori the statistics to be matched by the model, and so constitutes a more ﬂexible method than these alternative approaches. Finally, we show how to exploit a trained {SpikeGAN} to construct ’importance maps’ to detect the most relevant statistical structures present in a spike train. Spike-{GAN} provides a powerful, easy-to-use technique for generating realistic spiking neural activity and for describing the most relevant features of the large-scale neural population recordings studied in modern systems neuroscience.},

The design was a mixed-method service evaluation of an eight-session {MBCT} programme for young people who were recovering from depression. The course was a manualised eight-session group intervention. Both young people (n = 18) and parents (n = 21) completed validated measures before and after the course. Semi-structured interviews were completed with some group participants and clinical staff working in the service. Care records were searched for additional contact following the intervention. Qualitative data from young people, parents and clinicians suggested that {MBCT} was acceptable and feasible and provided strategies to cope. The parent course was reported to provide personal support to parents and helped them cope with their child’s depression whilst also impacting the family, promoted shared understanding of depression and strategies to combat it and addressed intergenerational aspects of depression. Eighty-four per cent of participants attended at least 6/8 sessions, and 48\% required no further intervention within the following year. Young people had statistically significant improvements across all outcome measures, whilst parents had statistically significant improvements in rumination, self-compassion and decentring.},

In this work, we evaluate the use of an {HMD}-based environment for the exploration of multidimensional data, represented in 3D scatterplots as a result of dimensionality reduction ({DR}). We present a new modeling for this problem, accounting for the two factors whose interplay deter- mine the impact on the overall task performance: the difference in errors introduced by performing dimensionality reduction to 2D or 3D, and the difference in human perception errors under different visualization conditions. This two-step framework offers a simple approach to estimate the benefits of using an immersive 3D setup for a particular dataset. Here, the {DR} errors for a series of roll call voting datasets when using two or three dimensions are evaluated through an empirical task-based approach. The perception error and overall task performance, on the other hand, are assessed through a comparative user study with 30 participants. Results indicated that perception errors were low and similar in all approaches, resulting in overall performance benefits in both desktop and {HMD}-based 3D techniques. The immersive condition, however, was found to require less effort to find information and less navigation, besides providing much larger subjective perception of accuracy and engagement.},

Unfortunately, making {VR} available in professional application scenarios or even using it on a regular basis has proven to be challenging. We argue that everyday usage environments, such as office spaces, have introduced constraints that critically affect the design of interaction concepts since well-established techniques might be difficult to use. In our opinion, it is crucial to understand the impact of usage scenarios on interaction design, to successfully develop {VR} applications for everyday use. To substantiate our claim, we define three distinct usage scenarios in this work that primarily differ in the amount of mobility they allow for. We outline each scenario's inherent constraints but also point out opportunities that may be used to design novel, well-suited interaction techniques for different everyday usage environments. In addition, we link each scenario to a concrete application example to clarify its relevance and show how it affects interaction design.},

We present a design study of a new virtual reality ({VR}) system, developed in collaboration with trained neuroanatomists, to trace neurons in microscope scans of the visual cortex of primates. We hypothesize that using consumer-grade {VR} technology to interact with neurons directly in 3D will help neuroscientists better resolve complex cases and enable them to trace neurons faster and with less physical and mental strain. We discuss both the design process and technical challenges in developing an interactive system to navigate and manipulate terabyte-sized image volumes in {VR}.

	abstract = {Immersive data analytics as an emerging research topic in scientiﬁc and information visualization has recently been brought back into the focus due to the emergence of low-cost consumer virtual reality hardware. Previous research has shown the positive impact of immersive visualization on data analytics workﬂows, but in most cases insights were based on large-screen setups. In contrast, less research focuses on a close integration of immersive technology into existing, i.e., desktop-based data analytics workﬂows. This implies speciﬁc requirements regarding the usability of such systems, which include, i.e., the prevention of cybersickness. In this work, we present a prototypical application, which offers a ﬁrst set of tools and addresses major challenges for a fully immersive data analytics setting in which the user is sitting at a desktop. In particular, we address the problem of cybersickness by integrating prevention strategies combined with individualized user proﬁles to maximize time of use.},

Our environments differ in how they exploit natural human perception and interaction capabilities. We compare an augmented-reality head-mounted display (Microsoft {HoloLens}), a handheld tablet, and a desktop setup. The novel head-mounted {HoloLens} display projects stereoscopic images of virtual content into a user's real world and allows for interaction in-situ at the spatial position of the 3D hologram. The tablet is able to interact with 3D content through touch, spatial positioning, and tangible markers, however, 3D content is still presented on a 2D surface. Our hypothesis is that visualization environments that match human perceptual and interaction capabilities better to the task at hand improve understanding of 3D visualizations. To better understand the space of display and interaction modalities in visualization environments, we first propose a classification based on three dimensions: perception, interaction, and the spatial and cognitive proximity of the two. Each technique in our study is located at a different position along these three dimensions. We asked 15 participants to perform four tasks, each task having different levels of difficulty for both spatial perception and degrees of freedom for interaction. Our results show that each of the tested environments is more effective for certain tasks, but that generally the desktop environment is still fastest and most precise in almost all cases.},

This article reviews the current practice and then theoretically and empirically examines several suitable tests. Based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of classiﬁers: the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two classiﬁers and the Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc tests for comparison of more classiﬁers over multiple data sets.

	shorttitle = {"Why Should I Trust You?},
	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose {LIME}, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

Projection pursuit is used to choose a projection of the variables that best separates the classes. Utilizing linear combinations of variables to separate classes takes the correlation between variables into account which allows {PPF} to outperform a traditional random forest when separations between groups occurs in combinations of variables. The method presented here can be used in multi-class problems and is implemented into an R (R Core Team, 2018) package, {PPforest}, which is available on {CRAN}, with development versions at https://github.com/natydasilva/{PPforest}.},

In this paper we propose, analyze and evaluate {LION}-{tSNE} (Local Interpolation with Outlier {coNtrol}) - a novel approach for incorporating new data into {tSNE} representation. {LION}-{tSNE} is based on local interpolation in the vicinity of training data, outlier detection and a special outlier mapping algorithm. We show that {LION}-{tSNE} method is robust both to outliers and to new samples from existing clusters. We also discuss multiple possible improvements for special cases. We compare {LION}-{tSNE} to a comprehensive list of possible benchmark approaches that include multiple interpolation techniques, gradient descent for new data, and neural network approximation.},

Our experimental baseline is the approximate knowledge that was available before {LEP}, and our comparison model is the Standard Model with a simple dark matter candidate. To quantify the amount by which experiments have altered our relative belief in the {CMSSM} since the baseline data we compute the Bayes factors that arise from learning in sequence the {LEP} Higgs constraints, the {XENON}100 dark matter constraints, the 2011 {LHC} supersymmetry search results, and the early 2012 {LHC} Higgs search results. We find that {LEP} and the {LHC} strongly shatter our trust in the {CMSSM} (with \$M\_0\$ and \$M\_\{1/2\}\$ below 2 {TeV}), reducing its posterior odds by a factor of approximately two orders of magnitude. This reduction is largely due to substantial Occam factors induced by the {LEP} and {LHC} Higgs searches.},

	abstract = {Finding clusters in data, especially high dimensional data, is challenging when the clusters are of widely diﬀering shapes, sizes, and densities, and when the data contains noise and outliers. We present a novel clustering technique that addresses these issues. Our algorithm ﬁrst ﬁnds the nearest neighbors of each data point and then redeﬁnes the similarity between pairs of points in terms of how many nearest neighbors the two points share. Using this deﬁnition of similarity, our algorithm identiﬁes core points and then builds clusters around the core points. The use of a shared nearest neighbor deﬁnition of similarity alleviates problems with varying densities and high dimensionality, while the use of core points handles problems with shape and size. While our algorithm can ﬁnd the “dense” clusters that other clustering algorithms ﬁnd, it also ﬁnds clusters that these approaches overlook, i.e., clusters of low or medium density which represent relatively uniform regions “surrounded” by non-uniform or higher density areas. We experimentally show that our algorithm performs better than traditional methods (e.g., K-means, {DBSCAN}, {CURE}) on a variety of data sets: {KDD} Cup ‘99 network intrusion data, {NASA} Earth science time series data, and two-dimensional point sets. The run-time complexity of our technique is O(n2) if the similarity matrix has to be constructed. However, we discuss a number of optimizations that allow the algorithm to handle large data sets eﬃciently.},

The collection of two-planes in a d-dimensional space is called a Grassmannian manifold. A key feature of the grand tour is that the projection planes are chosen according to a dense, continuous path through the Grassmannian manifold which yields the visual impression of points moving continuously.},

Projections can easily display aspects of structure that are only of low dimension, and sections–that is, intersections of subspaces with a high-dimensional object–can easily display structure of only low codimension (and hence often high dimension). However, compositions of sections and projections, here called prosections, can display aspects of structure of any intermediate dimension. These statements are relevant for data analysis: projections of data can be easily generated with x-y scatterplots, three-dimensional (3-D) data rotations, and grand tours; sections can be approximated in existing systems by scatterplot brushing and painting. Thus this article is in part an investigation into the principles underlying these techniques.},

The collision includes an intermediate process H → τ +τ −produced with a branching fraction of 6.4\%. The Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge held in 2014 saw many participants sharing ideas on how to improve selection methods in the {ATLAS} datasets. Here, we attempt this challenge using Random Forests due to its eﬀectiveness in decision making. Four diﬀerent splitting criteria Gini, Information Gain, One-Sided Extreme and One-Sided Purity were used to model our random forests. Classiﬁcation rate of for the background class was found to be 0.76 ± 0.5, 0.75 ± 0.4, 0.53 ± 0.2, 0.66 ± 0.4 for Gini, Information Gain, One-Sided Extreme and One-Sided Purity respectively. The signal class had a classiﬁcation rate of 0.77 ± 0.3, 0.79 ± 0.4, 0.79 ± 0.4, 0.66 ± 0.4 for Gini, Information Gain, One-Sided Extreme and One-Sided Purity respectively. The variable importance was measured according to the splitting criteria, in which some leading order variables were analysed in a predicted model by producing a histogram of the ’true’ data versus density of the predicted model. The preliminary analysis, although lacking in sample size, provided promising indications that it could be an eﬀective method upon further development.},

If each observation is represented as a point in multidimensional space, this means finding the structure of a configuration of points in high-dimensional space. To find linear relationships among the variables, linear regression, principal components, and factor analysis are often used. One very simple and important kind of structure is clustering. Whenever the points cluster together, the knowledge of this is almost sure to be useful to the man who is interested in the data. Some structure-seeking methods depend on the distances between the points. For example, many cluster-seeking techniques look for collections of points whose interpoint distances are small in some sense. Similarly, the method of parametric mapping starts by calculating the matrix of interpoint distances of the original configuration and subsequently works only with that.},

	doi = {10.1117/12.172065},
	abstract = {Grand tours are a class of methods for visualizing multivariate data, or any finite set of points in n-space. The idea is to create an animation of data projections by moving a 2-dimensional projection plane through n-space. The path of planes used in the animation is chosen so that it becomes dense, that is, it comes arbitrarily close to any plane. One inspiration for the grand tour was the experience of trying to comprehend an abstract sculpture in a museum. One tends to walk around the sculpture, viewing it from many different angles. A useful class of grand tours is based on the idea of continuously interpolating an infinite sequence of randomly chosen planes. Visiting randomly (more precisely: uniformly) distributed planes guarantees denseness of the interpolating path. In computer implementations, 2-dimensional orthogonal projections are specified by two 1- dimensional projections which map to the horizontal and vertical screen dimensions, respectively. Hence, a grand tour is specified by a path of pairs of orthonormal projection vectors. This paper describes an interpolation scheme for smoothly connecting two pairs of orthonormal vectors, and thus for constructing interpolating grand tours. The scheme is optimal in the sense that connecting paths are geodesics in a natural Riemannian geometry.},

Sectioning, or slicing, through high dimensions is less common, but can be useful for visualising data with concavities, or non-linear structure. It is associated with conditional distributions in statistics, and also linked brushing between plots in interactive data visualisation. This short technical note describes a simple approach for slicing in the orthogonal space of projections obtained when running a tour, thus presenting the viewer with an interpolated sequence of sliced projections. The method has been implemented in R as an extension to the tourr package, and can be used to explore for concave and non-linear structures in multivariate distributions.},

Our relationships to virtual realities, artificial intelligence, neuro-implants or pervasive, cyberphysical systems generate ontological uncertainties, epistemological diffusion and ethical conundrums that require us to consider evolving the current research paradigm. I look to post-humanism and relational ontologies to sketch what I call Entanglement {HCI} in response. I review selected theories—Actor-Network Theory, Post-Phenomenology, Object-Oriented Ontology, Agential Realism—and their existing influences on {HCI} literature. Against this background, I develop Entanglement {HCI} from the following four perspectives: (a) the performative relationship between humans and technology; (b) the re-framing of knowledge generation processes around phenomena; (c) the tracing of accountabilities, responsibilities and ethical encounters; and (d) the practices of design and mattering that move beyond user-centred design.},

	abstract = {Projection pursuit is used to find interesting low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional data by optimizing an index over all possible projections. Most indexes have been developed to detect departure from known distributions, such as normality, or to find separations between known groups. Here, we are interested in finding projections revealing potentially complex bivariate patterns, using new indexes constructed from scagnostics and a maximum information coefficient, with a purpose to detect unusual relationships between model parameters describing physics phenomena. The performance of these indexes is examined with respect to ideal behaviour, using simulated data, and then applied to problems from gravitational wave astronomy. The implementation builds upon the projection pursuit tools available in the R package, tourr, with indexes constructed from code in the R packages, scagnostics, minerva and mbgraphic.},

	shorttitle = {Hole or grain?},
	abstract = {Multivariate data is often visualized using linear projections, produced by techniques such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and projection pursuit. A problem with projections is that they obscure low and high density regions near the center of the distribution. Sections, or slices, can help to reveal them. This paper develops a section pursuit method, building on the extensive work in projection pursuit, to search for interesting slices of the data. Linear projections are used to define sections of the parameter space, and to calculate interestingness by comparing the distribution of observations, inside and outside a section. By optimizing this index, it is possible to reveal features such as holes (low density) or grains (high density). The optimization is incorporated into a guided tour so that the search for structure can be dynamic. The approach can be useful for problems when data distributions depart from uniform or normal, as in visually exploring nonlinear manifolds, and functions in multivariate space. Two applications of section pursuit are shown: exploring decision boundaries from classification models, and exploring subspaces induced by complex inequality conditions from multiple parameter model. The new methods are available in R, in the tourr package.},

This method is useful to hide classified military secrets, as we compress it to a large amount in the form of text, yet it can be regenerated in mathmod software, after decrypting it using the key. In this study, we propose a new way to formulate polynomial equation of any objects in context by fitting it using brute force techniques. We find that the complexity of the algorithm is too high to be achieved in practical scenarios, which encourages more efficient work in this new field.},

Thus, the efficient implementation on recent architectures is required to provide a useful kernel for high-performance applications. In this article, we consider the process of orthogonalizing a set of vectors with the Gram–Schmidt method and develop {SIMD} implementations for processors providing the Advanced Vector Extensions ({AVX}), which is a set of instructions for {SIMD} execution on recent Intel and {AMD} {CPUs}. Several {SIMD} implementations of the Gram–Schmidt process for vector orthogonalization are built, and their behavior with respect to performance and energy is investigated. Especially, different ways to implement the {SIMD} programs are proposed and several optimizations have been studied. As hardware platforms, the Intel Core, Xeon and Xeon Phi processors with the {AVX} versions {AVX}, {AVX}2 and {AVX}512 have been used.},

	abstract = {Data tours follow an exploratory multi-dimensional data visualization concept that provides animations of projections of the multidimensional data to a 2D visual space. To create an animation, a sequence of key projections is provided and morphings between each pair of consecutive key projections are computed, which then can be stitched together to form the data tour. The morphings should be smooth so that a user can easily follow the transformations, and their computations shall be fast to allow for their integration into an interactive visual exploration process. Moreover, if the key projections are chosen to satisfy additional conditions, it is desirable that these conditions are maintained during morphing. Shape preservation is such a desirable condition, as it avoids shape distortions that may otherwise be caused by a projection. We develop a novel efﬁcient morphing algorithms for computing shape-preserving data tours, i.e., data tours constructed for a sequence of shape-preserving linear projections. We propose a stepping strategy for the morphing to avoid discontinuities in the evolution of the projections, where we represent the linear projections using a star-coordinates system. Our algorithms are less computationally involved, produce smoother morphings, and require less user-deﬁned parameter settings than existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {The use of head-mounted displays ({HMD}) for virtual reality ({VR}) application-based purposes including therapy, rehabilitation, and training is increasing. Despite advancements in {VR} technologies, many users still experience sickness symptoms. {VR} sickness may be influenced by technological differences within {HMDs} such as resolution and refresh rate, however, {VR} content also plays a significant role. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the literature on {HMDs} that report Simulator Sickness Questionnaire ({SSQ}) scores to determine the impact of content. User factors associated with {VR} sickness were also examined. A systematic search was conducted according to {PRISMA} guidelines. Fifty-five articles met inclusion criteria, representing 3,016 participants (mean age range 19.5–80; 41\% female). Findings show gaming content recorded the highest total {SSQ} mean 34.26 (95\%{CI} 29.57–38.95). {VR} sickness profiles were also influenced by visual stimulation, locomotion and exposure times. Older samples (mean age ≥35 years) scored significantly lower total {SSQ} means than younger samples, however, these findings are based on a small evidence base as a limited number of studies included older users. No sex differences were found. Across all types of content, the pooled total {SSQ} mean was relatively high 28.00 (95\%{CI} 24.66–31.35) compared with recommended {SSQ} cut-off scores. These findings are of relevance for informing future research and the application of {VR} in different contexts.},

	abstract = {Data visualisation is an important part of understanding the distributions, trends, correlations and relationships in materials data sets, as well as communicating results to others. Traditionally visualisation has been straightforward, particularly when studying single-structure/single-property relationships. It is not so straightforward when confronted with a materials data set represented by a large number of features, and containing multi-structure/multi-property relationships. Here we use Kohonen networks, or self-organising maps, to aid in the visualise sets of silver and platinum nanoparticles based on structural similarity and overlay functional properties to reveal hidden patterns and structure/property relationships. We compare these maps to a popular alternative dimension reduction method and find them superior for our cases where the structure/property relationships are highly nonlinear, and the data set is imbalanced, as they often are in materials science.},

However, despite the fact that comparative visualization is frequently needed – scientists, engineers, and even humanists must routinely compare such data – visualization users and practitioners suffer from a lack of adequate Spatial 3D comparative visualization tools and guidelines. Here we survey the field and present a taxonomy for classifying existing and new comparison visualization techniques for such data into four fundamental approaches: Juxtaposition, Superimposition, Interchangeable, and Explicit Encoding. The results clarify the key design decisions and tradeoffs that designers must make to create an effective comparative Spatial 3D data visualization and suggest the potential of emerging hybrid approaches, ones creatively combining aspects of the four fundamental approaches.},
